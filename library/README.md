# Library

General collection of snippets and ideas to modify and utilize.

Unless otherwise labeled, everything is written by me and falls under the public domain.

## Notes

- Indexing is 0-based

- Intervals are half-open, like this $[l, r)$

- GCC and C++17 may be required for everything to function properly
