# Library

Rather than a polished collection of code meant to be used as-is, this is more of a general collection of ideas and snippets to modify and utilize.

Unless otherwise labeled, everything is written by me and falls under the public domain.

## Notes

- Indexing is 0-based

- Intervals are half-open, like this $[l, r)$

- GCC and C++17 may be required for everything to function properly
