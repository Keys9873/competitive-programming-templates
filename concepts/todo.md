# Things to add
Basically, I'm trying to write about/prove these things.

## Graph
* Shortest paths (bfs/dijkstra)
* Shortest paths (floyd-warshall)
* Minimum spanning tree (kruskal)
* Strongly connected components (tarjan)
* DSU path compression optimization
* Tree diameter
* Degree of planar graphs
* Properties of binary trees
* Edges to/from a range

## Misc/adhoc
* DAG and tree shaped moves
* Minimum pairwise XOR
* Pair deletions
* Maximize product

## Number theory
* Arithmetic mod prime

## Combinatorics
* Stars and bars (variations)
* Linearity of expectation(?)
* Stirling numbers of the first kind

## Datastructure
* Properties of segment tree items
* Bottom up, succinct segment trees
* Sparse and persistent segment trees
* Binary indexed trees(?)
* Sparse tables
* Mo's algorithm (arrays, tree paths(?))
* Euler tour (subtrees, tree paths(?))
* Sqrt-based data structures

## Game theory
* Basic arguments
