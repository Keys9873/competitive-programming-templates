# cp-library
My library code for programming contests.

## Notes

0-indexing and half intervals $[l, r)$ are used everywhere.

These implementations should be fairly fast. However, my main focus is keeping everything short and easy to understand and modify, so they're not topping library checker leaderboards or anything.

The `ll` typedef as well as `sz(x)` and `all(x)` may be used.
```cpp
using ll = long long;
#define sz(x) static_cast<int>(size(x))
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
```
