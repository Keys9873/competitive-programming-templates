# cp-library
This repository contains my library code for programming contests. The primary goals of these implementations are to maintain brevity, ensure ease of understanding, and also strive for reasonable execution speed.

## Notes

This library is macro-free. Just include the needed STL headers and `using namespace std`.

All indexing is 0-based, and half-open intervals of the form $[l, r)$ are employed.

Implementations may make use of GCC-specific features, such as `__lg`, as well as library functions defined in the C++17 standard.
