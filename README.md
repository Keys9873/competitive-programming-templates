# cp-library
My library code for programming contests.

## Notes

0-indexing and half intervals $[l, r)$ are used everywhere.

Implementations may not be the fastest, but they should be fast enough. My main focus is keeping everything short and easy to understand/modify/remember.

The `ll` typedef as well as `sz(x)` and `all(x)` may be used.
```cpp
using ll = long long;
#define sz(x) static_cast<int>(size(x))
#define all(x) begin(x), end(x)
```
