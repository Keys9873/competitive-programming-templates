# cp-library
This repository contains my library code for programming contests.

This is less of a polished collection of code meant to be used as-is, and more of a general collection of ideas and snippets to modify and use.

Unless labeled otherwise, everything is written by me and is public domain.

## Notes

- Indexing is 0-based
- Intervals are half-open, like this $[l, r)$
- GCC and C++17 may be required for everything to work
