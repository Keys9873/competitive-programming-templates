# cp-library
This repository contains my library code for programming contests.

No defines or typedefs are used (outside of possibly `template.cpp`). Just include the needed STL headers and `using namespace std`.

All indexing is 0-based, and half-open intervals of the form $[l, r)$ are employed.

Implementations may make use of GCC-specific features, such as `__lg`, as well as library functions defined in the C++17 standard.
